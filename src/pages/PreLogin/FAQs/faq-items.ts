        question: "Is this only for Shorts, Reels, and TikToks?",
        answer: "Yes. We're built only for vertical, under-1-minute videos."
    },
    {
        question: "Can this help me go viral?",
        answer: "We don't promise views — but we show what kills virality so you can fix it before posting."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need editing skills?",
        answer: "Nope. Upload your clip and get instant feedback in plain English."
    },
    {
        question: "How fast do I get results?",
        answer: "Seconds. Drop your video and see your hook, pacing, captions scored instantly."
    },
    {
        question: "Why aren't my shorts getting views?",
        answer: "Probably weak hooks, bad pacing, or messy captions. We catch those before you publish."
    },
    {
        question: "What's different from YouTube or TikTok analytics?",
        answer: "Analytics tells you what went wrong after. We tell you before you post."
    },
    {
        question: "Does this work for any niche?",
        answer: "Yes. Comedy, gaming, fitness, business — retention rules are universal."
    },
    {
        question: "Will it tell me exactly what to fix?",
        answer: "Yes. Clear notes like 'hook drags' or 'captions too fast,' not vague scores."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need pro gear for this?",
        answer: "No. Even iPhone clips can go viral if your pacing and hook are strong."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I trust AI to judge my content?",
        answer: "Yes — it's trained on the playbook of our Founder, Sebastian Costa (1M+ @YouTube). This is Bas's brain, AI just makes it instant."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this like having a coach?",
        answer: "Pretty much, but instant and way affordable."
    },
    {
        question: "What if my video is already good?",
        answer: "Then you'll know it's not your edit — maybe your idea or posting strategy."
    }
